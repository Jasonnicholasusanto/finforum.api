# For API request/response validation and shape definitions (Pydantic models)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What it is: A shape/definition of data — what fields exist, what types they are, and any validation rules.
# Purpose: Used to communicate what data is expected in requests or returned in responses.
# Significance: Keeps your API predictable, safe, and documented automatically via OpenAPI/Swagger.
# Does not know about the database — purely about data structure and validation.
